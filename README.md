## Introduction

This project is the result of the abstraction of the Uber application into four different object-oriented programming languages.

## Features

The purpose of the project is to understand the concepts related to the paradigm of object-oriented programming, such as:
- Abstraction
- Modularity
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism

To achieve that goal, ride sharing service was taken as an example of modeling. First, this service was modeled through the standard called Unified Modeling Language (UML). This modeling is shown in the following image in a simplified way.

</p>

After obtaining the model, it was expressed in java, php, javascript and python. For each of them it was shown:
- How to create a class
- How to instantiate an object
- How to create superclasses and subclasses
- How to implement encapsulation
- How to implement override (polymorphism)
